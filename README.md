# Reproducible Data Assignment
This project consists of an RProj, the main R markdown file, and some necessary/relevant subfiles (data, functions, and figures).

The packages that are required to be installed are: "ggplot2", "palmerpenguins", "janitor", "dplyr", and "ragg", which can be carried out with the following code: install.packages(c("ggplot2", "palmerpenguins", "janitor", "dplyr", "ragg")).

Run the code in the markdown file and direct your attention to question 2, which goes through a full data pipeline, from introduction and hypothesis through to results, discussion, and conclusion.
